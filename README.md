plg_k2categorytemplate
======================

Allow user to set the template to use based on the content category being viewed. If a template style has been set through the menu item parameter, we retain that setting. If the K2 category inherits from another category, we also search for a match there, but only if there is no direct category match. Based on SM2 Section Template plugin.
