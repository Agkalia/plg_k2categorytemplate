plg_k2categorytemplate
======================

Allow user to set the template to use based on the content category being viewed. If a template style has been set through the menu item parameter, we retain that setting. If the K2 category inherits from another category, we also search for a match there, but only if there is no direct category match.

Compatible with Joomla 2.5.x and K2 2.5.x

Install plugin, enable, and add pairs as "category ID,template folder".
Example: 5,beez_20

Based on SM2 Section Template plugin.
